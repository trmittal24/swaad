> Craving that restaurant style curry, or that lip-smacking dhaba dish? Too hard to replicate? Why fear when I'm here? Let me help.

Take your food to the next level, by using fats correctly in your cooking, don't underuse it, but don't overdo it either. Our traditional home food generally has less oil than outside food, but that's what (in addition to other tips coming your way soon üòâ) makes their food more desirable. More fat doesn't necessarily imply unhealthy, because remember, you, at your home, are using good fats, and it won't cause you any problems. 

We covered the differences between the various types of fats and their importance in food in <a href="https://swaad.in.net/oils_and_fats/">this article</a>, and this is a follow-up to that. 
Today, I take you through using different Fats at different stages of cooking to get the ultimate result,  which will leave your guests licking their fingers. 

If we notice, some or the other kind of fat forms an integrally important part of every cuisine. 

- Ghee        - Punjabi and Marwadi Cuisine
- Mustard Oil - Bihar and Bengali Cuisine
- Coconut Oil - Kerala Cuisine
- Sesame Oil  - Chinese Food
- Olive Oil   - Italian Cuisine
- Butter      - French Cuisine

Many Asian and Western Cuisines also use meat-based fat as the main part of their dish. 

So, by selecting the right Fat, you are already halfway into making a great dish! :D

How to use them? Lets's get started!

### ‚ùñ Using Oils in Dish

You could use oils and fat at multiple stages in a dish:
- In the prep before cooking. (In batter/dough)
- Starting point of cooking. (To release flavours and form base of dish)
- Finishing up the dish. (Tempering or dressing)

#### ‚ùñ Upping the Prep

Oil is sometimes added in a batter or a dough. 
In the batter, oil prevents sticking of the batter to the pan and adds shine to the dish.
In a dough, as we looked in this article <a href="https://swaad.in.net/dough/">"Dough | Kneads and Needs"</a>, it is used to achieve different textures, crumbliness depending on requirement. 

#### ‚ùñ Building the Foundation

This is the most important step where oil comes into play since this defines your entire dish.
Heat your utensil first before adding oil, never ever add oil in a cold pan/wok. That's preposterous, for god's sake! Technically, if you add oil before, it kindof sticks and gets more time to break down and burn. So, remember this rule of thumb!. 

Add your dry spices, fresh spices, and other parts of dish in that order. Why? Because your spices form the flavour profile and by adding them before you give them opportunity to release the flavours for your dish to fully embrace them. 

Oil plays another important role during cooking, once the oil starts separating from your curry, that's an indication of the curry having completed cooking!

#### ‚ùñ The Star (Michelin?) in the End

This, this final step is what truly brings the dish alive, Indian or Italian, what the restaurants use to up their game, and what many of us cooking at home underestimate. 

Tempering or Tadka as we know it, just before the dish is served, brings out all the aromas of the dish and spices, and also a beautiful tempting colour, teasing all your senses to devour the food. But, do the tadka right, you don't have to complicate it, choose a oil, a flavouring spice, an aromatic spice, and a colouring spice (usually red chilli powder).

Another trick in the hat? Drop a dollop of butter before serving your gravy-based curry (not requiring tadka) and mix it well. This provides unmatched richness to it. 

This the same way we apply ghee or butter to our rotis, this improves the flavour since cereal + fat are a good combo, plus it prevents the roti from drying out. 

Italian food uses the same trick with Olive oil, which is drizzled over cooked pizza before serving. Many salads are also dressed using Olive oil or Mayo (a type of fat, again). Remember, this is extra virgin olive oil used here, which is totally fine to be consumed raw without being heated. 


So, thats it, your guide to improving your cooking game, one tips among many to come. I am sure, the next time you cook, you are going to use the oils right, not gonna shy away and let your dish shine! (pun intended üòÅ)
