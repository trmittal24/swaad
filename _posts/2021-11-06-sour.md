> Sourness, a word not quite the one that gives positive vibes. But? Also an element of your food, which is required to complete the circle of perfect flavour. 

Don't believe me? Sourness is present in almost all your dishes in various forms! 

‣ *That dash of lime juice in your daal*   
‣ *The sour and sweet tamarind chutney for your chaats*  
‣ *Tangy tomato present in ketchup or your favourite chips (But honestly, who even likes those Red Tangy Potato Chips?)*  
‣ *Curd bringing in the slight sourness to your gravy based curries*  
‣ *Vinegar in the Indo-Chinese dishes!*  

You think I am done? No, wait. Even idlis, dosas, breads taste the way they do because of induced acidity. How? Fermentation! 
The batters for Idlis and Dosas are fermented overnight to make them airy and bring in the acidic profile. 

‣ *Doughs for pizzas, breads, naan are fermented for long time using yeast or curd, which gives them the unique flavour.*  
‣ *Cheese aged for a long time has a distinctive sourness*  
‣ *Pickles! What even is a pickle which isn't sour? And how it helps to complete your meal!*  

Am I done now? Maybe 😝. The list is non-exhaustive, but I hope I have covered many of our day to day meals and made it clear how important of a role sourness or acid plays in our food. 

Let's dig in a little deeper to understand why this happens and how can you leverage it to elevate your food. 


### ❖ Acids: What? How? Why?

*Mouthwatering* 🤤 is synonymous to food being delicious, and you know what? It's the acidic food that makes your mouth water the most i.e your mouth releases the most saliva when eating something sour to balance the acidity. 
Acid is actually one of the flavours which we crave the most, and it's important to understand how you can add this dimension to your food. 

Acid, like <a href="https://swaad.in.net/salt">Salt</a> and <a href="https://swaad.in.net/oils_and_fats/">Fats</a> is one of the most basic element which can easily be added to your food and probably fetches more rewards than the effort you put in. 😋

Acids as we saw in the examples above, come in various forms, you can add them as a seasoning towards the end, you can make it the base of your food, or you could let your food nurture and develop the acidic nature on it's own. 
Every method or every ingredient has a completely different degree of acidity to it, and it becomes helpful to know how much of flavour everything brings in individually and layer them right. 

Let's learn them one by one, and hopefully by the end of it, you would already have multiple ideas to impress people with your food. 

### ❖ Lemon, Vinegar : Let's start simple 🍋

These are probably the easiest ways to get started and induce the new flavour.

Lemon? It's best enjoyed fresh, and hence always put it as a garnish once the cooking is complete. The dish can be as simple as a boiled corn, or daal or complex like paneer tikka masala. What unites them? Lemon juice as a garnish towards the end, and you can call yourself a chef. 😉
You can add it in salads, rice or anything which doesn't have any acidic component yet. In addition to bringing in sourness, it also adds freshness and you have yourself an awesome meal. 

Feeling fancy? Try replacing it with fresh orange or sweet lime juice in simple dishes like salad and stir frys. Experiment, but be cautious to try it out in small batches. 

Vinegar which we use is mostly synthetically produced but you also have natural variants like apple-cidar vinegar, balsamic vinegar and the likes. All of them are acidic, with their own unique additional taste. Vinegars usually need some cooking and you should add it towards the last 10-15% cooking time. 

### ❖ Tomato, Tamarind : Two to Tango 🍅

</p>

These elements are a little different from the previous ones, since instead of finishing the dish, they usually form the base and define the flavour profile of the dish. 

Tomatoes are naturally sour, but it has so many variants that it's hard to quantify its sourness definitively. So, if you are using sour tomatoes in a gravy, you probably don't need lemon at the end, but if it falls short, you always have it to rescue you.

Tamarind also acts more so like tomato but being much more sour and consistently sour. Use it controlled amounts.

Both of them need to be cooked enough to induce the flavour in the dish, always add them in the beginning. 

### ❖ Ageing : Old is Gold

> Slow and Steady Wins the Race!

Producing acid via Fermentation or essentially ageing, takes time, but develops a much more subtle, balanced and smooth acidic flavour in the dish. It may not be feasible all the time, but it is actually important step for many dishes. 
And anyway, for things like curd, pickle, cheese, idli batter, the ageing process is complete before you buy it. :)

**Bonus:** Many fruits like Pineapple, Kiwi, Grape, Raw Mango, Green Apple, Berries are naturally sour due to natural ripening (or ageing?) and don't require effort or cooking. Use them in salads, dips, in your own new way. 


Chef, you are now equipped with a new weapon in your kitchen. You learnt something new. We saw many ways to add acid to the food, and many ingredients in how they contribute. Remember to layer them well, maybe as the base, maybe to garnish well or to just give an accompaniment like lime juice or a sour dip. Avoid using too many acidic components in your dish to start with.
You have the weapon, start slow, learn and then excel with it.
