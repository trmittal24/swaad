> An oversized wok, flame so high you got to be cautious, a dash of oil, thinly sliced condiments and veggies thrown in, heavy tossing, in goes your rice or noodles, with seasoning and sauces, heavy tossing again, quick, off, spring onions, serve.

There you have, the most delicious, quickly made, *instant* noodles. 

> A cuisine so unique, that the Indians - young and old, absolutely love while the Chinese might find it tough to find the China-inspiration in the cuisine üòù 

Maybe a bit of exaggeration there, but the Indians have absolutely owned the cuisine and created something beautiful. A few inspirations here and there from many Asian nations, but the one which has evolved to suit the spice and tangy loving nation.

You find delicious hakka noodles, fried rice, manchurian being tossed up high in woks, their aroma spread in every other street - north to south, east to west. Why? Because people love it and it's actually very easy and quick. Just a few points to take care of, and soon those woks will be tossing lip-smacking food in your own kitchen. Let's find out how. üòã

**What makes up an Indo-Chinese dish?**

‚Ä£ Thinly sliced veggies/meat  
‚Ä£ Umami and a supporting flavour base  
‚Ä£ Quick cooking and constant movement on highest heat  
‚Ä£ Well defined separate components on the dish on serving. (Not a sticky mess)  

That's pretty much all about it, and let's get going to understand why these points are important and how to achieve them.

### ‚ùñ Technique, The Skill 

A perfect Indo-Chinese dish is the one, served right off the wok, steaming hot, all ingredients cooked enough to not be raw, but retain their crunchiness, everything separate that you can choose to nitpick (Don't!), with a subtle supporting spicy and other flavour, not overpowering. 

The thinly sliced veggies, high heat, and well-defined components are all interrelated, let me explain how.

#### ‚ùñ Heat and Using it right

All foods contain a large amount of water, and when you cook them, you essentially are reducing the water and cooking the proteins and starch. When you leave a bunch of chopped vegetables, they will cook, but at the same time, release water and get mushy in their own release. That is what we don't want.

So, now when you slice them thin, use high heat and move them around constantly (either tossing or constant stirring), you are making sure that:
-    The high heat and thin slice make them release water quickly. 
-    The constant movement ensures that the water doesn't stick around in the vessel and evaporates.

</p>

Whatever vessel you are using, ensure that you don't crowd it, leave enough empty room to move around your food. 

### ‚ùñ Umami, The Soul

What is umami? The savoury flavour, the aftertaste, little salty, but otherwise, divine. Hard to describe, probably the same reason why it was the last flavour to be discovered, and long after the others. Tomato ketchup, soy sauce, mushrooms, they have a strong umami flavour which you unknowingly crave for and that's what we are talking about here as well!

Soy sauce is strong in Umami and a bit of it goes a long way in improving your dish.
Cabbage, believe it or not, is full of Umami once cooked and that is why it is another essential (and also cheap) component of Chinese dishes. Believe it or not, roadside vendors create an entire Chinese dish with just cabbage and it still tastes great. Why? Umami.
Mushrooms and meat, both also have a huge percent of Umami and use them right to elevate your dish. 

And and and... Wait wait, there is one more, the polarising, the debatable component.  

**MSG** or **Ajinomoto**  
Its role? Pure *umami*.  
Pros? Heavenly taste.  
Cons? I don't know. People seem to avoid it. They probably don't like yummy food. 

In all honesty, *MSG* is not bad. You use it in proportions similar to salt (and also as a substitute). Anything in huge amounts is harmful, but use them controlled and it's all good. The researches done to prove MSG is bad used quantities much more than what you would consume otherwise. I will not go into detail just yet but leave you with a  <a href="https://youtu.be/E-POAKKH5IM">YouTube video</a> that does a good job.

My suggestion would be to replace 10-20% of your salt with MSG, and you will have a good balance of taste and health. 

### ‚ùñ Supporting Actors

We covered some important points above, but there are a few other good-to-know, will-be-handy tips too.

-   Freshly chopped Ginger and Garlic. Ginger is more important than we think and use it in equal amounts as garlic, don't skip, you will know. Crush the garlic using weight to release extra flavour.
-   Add some sourness (oh yes, a <a href="https://swaad.in.net/sour">throwback</a>). Vinegar or many of your chinese sauces will already have that. 
-   Wide range of veggies. Yes, they are important, adding more life to the food.
-   Rice? Use cold leftover rice to ensure they don't become mushy.  
    Noodles? Ensure you wash it well and cool down immediately once cooked to avoid the same mushy problem. 
-   Do garnish with spring onion greens if you have them, they are as important as dhaniya in Indian cuisine. :)


And well, that's about it. A detailed overview of your getting started with Indo-Chinese cooking. Learn these basics and create your dishes. I will cover specific mains like Chinese gravies and other things going ahead, but for now, get cooking with these. Have fun, and enjoy!
