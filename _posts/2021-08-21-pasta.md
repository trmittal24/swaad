> Quick, simple, healthy and tasty Italian pasta

Yes, and it doesn't require you to have any pre cooked sauce. By the end of this article, you will be able to whip up a fantastic Aglio e Olio (if I mayüòõ) and a few other varieties of pasta (your own creations too) in a matter of minutes. 
I'll cover all the basics of cooking pasta: boiling, sauce, seasoning and more. 

So, sit back and get ready to drool, now and later when you cook your own. 

### ‚ùñ Selecting the Pasta

In pasta, the pasta itself is a very very important component of the dish unlike most other dishes which have the sauce or the toppings dominating it. 

So, the selection of a quality pasta is very important. I highly recommend using durum wheat pasta, which has great texture, is very filling, are healthy, but a little expensive too. Don't worry, they are often at 50% off on Amazon (<a href="https://www.amazon.in/Disano-Fusilli-Durum-Wheat-Pasta/dp/B01LQB6G1I" >Pasta Link</a>, not sponsored, **yet**) üòõ. Most other pastas are made from maida(refined flour) which takes away the essence of pasta. But it's not an offense to use those. You can use the commonly available pasta if durum wheat isn't available.

Durum wheat is whole hard wheat, which is broken and milled. 

### ‚ùñ Boiling the pasta

> Your pasta water should be as salty as the Mediterranean.

Yes yes, that's a real quote and please follow it. 

Salt your pasta water heavily, all the taste lies there. Don't be shy. (Approximately 2tbsp salt in 1L of water)
And, don't put oil in your water. Not required, instead, you can oil the pasta after draining. 

Boil a good amount of water until it's bubbling. Generously salt it. And put the pasta only once it's boiling vigorously. Your pasta packet will have a time written on it. Cook for the specified time. 

How to check if it's done? It should have a little bite to it, shouldn't be full mushy, and also, when you cut through it, the pasta cross-section should be evenly coloured. If undercooked, you can usually see a white ring. 

Once done, you can leave the pasta in that. Don't drain the water, it is a nice starchy water (which the pasta released) that will help us thicken our sauce. 

### ‚ùñ The Final Act

</p>


Your boiled and well salted pasta is ready, you have some pasta water left too to thicken the sauce. The only thing left is mixing this with your preferred sauce (veggies, meat too if you prefer) and serve it piping hot. 

The formula is simple, 
1. Heat Pan, pour some oil+butter. 
2. Add garlic, saute, add your veggies. 
3. Add your sauce, cook it for a while.
4. Add the pasta, let them cook together for a few minutes and devour.

Now it's the 2nd and 3rd steps that define how different your dish becomes. Covering all the sauces is a deep dive of its own. But don't fret, today I'll be showing a classic Aglio e Olio Pasta (Oil and Garlic Pasta), which can be cooked up in a few minutes (Bachelor's dish alert!) and doesn't compromise on taste.

1. Heat some butter and oil together (remember, the oil prevents the butter from burning)
2. Add crushed garlic, chilli flakes (you can chop dry red chilli too!) in the cold oil and saute till light brown colour.
3. Once done, add your pasta along with some pasta water.
4. The butter with the pasta water will form a simple sauce and will coat pasta. If required you can add a little bit of more butter/pasta water, according to the amount it's cooked. 
5. Add some grated cheese to this to give an extra richness and flavour. (Optional)
6. Done, check for salt, add black pepper, oregano and finish it with chopped coriander. (Parsley if you feel fancy)


Done Dana Done, eat this quick dish and have fun. It's really easy to make variations of this as well, by trying different veggies, playing with the amount of cheese. I hope you something to take away from this article, as to how to cook a good pasta and what forms it basics. Head to your kitchen, make something and hit me up with your creations!
