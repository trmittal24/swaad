  <p>Throw away this useless idiot box. Takes space and does nothing else than reheat vegetables.üòí</p>

<p>Does this remind you of something? TV, really? Well, we still use it enough. It‚Äôs the microwave oven we are talking about here.</p>

<p>We find it in most of the middle class kitchens in India but its under-utilization cannot be understated. We buy for the kicks of it, looks good, is modern, but we ultimately reduce it to a curry and rice reheating machine and nothing else.</p>

<p>So, today, we will look at a few tips and tricks which will help you get more out of your microwave oven and also up your kitchen game!</p>

<p>But but but‚Ä¶ hold on. Let‚Äôs just talk about how the microwave actually functions for a bit, so that we can appreciate its uses better, and you can find your own innovative ways to use it.</p>

<h3 id="-science-behind-microwaves">‚ùñ Science Behind Microwaves</h3>

<p>Microwave is an electromagnetic wave, just like the waves used by your phones to communicate, and just like the X-Rays we get during a fracture diagnosis. So, what‚Äôs the difference? Well, I will not deep dive, but they all have different frequencies which set them apart, and give them unique characteristics. Microwaves, when used correctly at the right power in the right way, were found to heat up water molecules very effectively and thus the microwave oven came into existence. (Kind of simplified.)</p>

<p>The microwaves, excite the water molecules and vibrate them a billion times every second, the vibrations produce heat, which allows us to get hot water instantly.</p>

<p>Whenever you heat up anything in a microwave, what you are essentially doing is, just heating up the water, and almost all food contents have water, and they heat up pretty quickly.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs it. So simple. :)</p>

<h3 id="-tips-and-tricks">‚ùñ Tips and Tricks</h3>

<p>Now, let us move on to the Tips and Tricks of using the Microwave Oven.</p>

<h5 id="-reheat-food">‚Åï Reheat Food</h5>

<p>Yes, of course. You can quickly reheat curries, rice in a microwave. I suggest sprinkling your curry (if dry) and rice with a bit of water before reheating to prevent it from going very dry.</p>

<p>Reheating breads, pizzas or rotis doesn‚Äôt always yield good results due to reduced moisture. One thing you could do is, keep a glass of water inside the microwave along with them, so your breads will remain fresh, not dry and chewy.</p>

<h5 id="-roast-dry-fruits-and-nuts">‚Åï Roast Dry Fruits and Nuts</h5>

<p>Microwaving dry fruits and nuts like almonds, cashews or peanuts in microwave for 3-4 minutes with stirring at every minute yields pretty good results. You get a slightly toasted flavour, and they become crispy. Instant healthy snack.</p>

<h5 id="-crisp-up-chewy-food">‚Åï Crisp Up Chewy Food</h5>

<p>Similar to the above point, if any of your snacks, namkeen, nuts have become soft and chewy due to air and rainy weather, microwaving them is a great way to bring them back to life.</p>

<h5 id="-melt-butter">‚Åï Melt Butter</h5>

<p>Many recipes call for melted butter and you can use microwave for it. Beware, use a lower power setting and check in intervals of 10 seconds.</p>

<h5 id="-remove-tomato-garlic-peels">‚Åï Remove Tomato, Garlic Peels</h5>

<p>These are some really irritating cooking processes, and microwaving garlic for 10-20 secs and tomato for 1-2 minutes depending on size can ease your life. Make few cuts on tomato before, so that the peel can come off easily.</p>

<p>Also, tomato being mostly water, cooks much faster in microwave than on the stove. The same goes for potatoes too.</p>

<p>There are a few other tricks I found on the net, like microwaving lemon to get more juice out of it, but I have mentioned only the ones I have tried and tested myself.</p>

<h3 id="-grill">‚ùñ Grill</h3>

<p>This is another underused part of the microwave oven which I wanted to address. It doesn‚Äôt work on the microwave principle, but rather a more traditional, heating a rod, and transferring the heat via air.</p>

<p>The grill rod is located at the top of your oven, and it comes in very handy to give a nice char to your dish, maybe a slightly browned cheese on pizza, or a bread with smokey charred edges. Remember, try to put on dish on a high rack, closer to the top, to get faster results.</p>

<p>And well, as the name says, grill, so you can use it to grill veggies, paneer, meat for those <em>tikka</em> meals. It won‚Äôt be perfect but you can get decent results.</p>

<h3 id="-convection">‚ùñ Convection</h3>

<p>Convection mode works like grill, except the heating rods are on the side, and a fan circulates hot air throughout the oven. This mode tries to give you an environment closer to the traditional baking oven.</p>

<p>And that wraps this up! The main intention was to familiarize you with the microwave mode, explain how it works, and equip you with finding your own unique uses. If you find something cool, share it with me so I can append it here with all credits, so that everyone can benefit.</p>
