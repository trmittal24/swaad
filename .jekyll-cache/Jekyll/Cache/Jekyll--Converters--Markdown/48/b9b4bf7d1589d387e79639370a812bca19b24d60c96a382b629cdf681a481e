  <p>Salt is a strange and mysterious substance. This simple molecule brings food to life, and yet it is the only substance we eat that did not originate in a living thing.</p>

<p>I like this observation by <em>Krish Ashok</em> in his book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54968807-masala-lab"><em>Masala Lab</em></a></p>

<p>Welcome everyone to my blog <strong>Swaad</strong>, and I bring you my first article!
I decided since Salt/Namak is so so important, such an underrated ingredient and yet the hardest to measure, it‚Äôs only fair that I start my blog by addressing the biggest elephant in the kitchen.</p>

<p>Just to make things clear, I‚Äôm talking about Table Salt (Sodium Chloride, NaCl) right now. I‚Äôll cover some other commonly used salts too towards the end.</p>

<h3 id="why-is-it-important-and-why-should-you-use-it">Why is it important and why should you use it?</h3>
<p>Something is too bitter? <em>Salt it and make it better!</em><br />
Making a sweet dish? <em>Just add a pinch of salt, and elevate the flavour.</em><br />
Making a savoury meal? <em>You know the drill, add salt and it will increase the aroma!</em><br />
It also helps balance sourness and the overall flavour of the dish.</p>

<p><strong>Bonus Tip</strong>: Adding salt while cooking makes vegetables lose water quickly and speeds up the cooking process! Now you know what to do when that damn dish is taking forever to cook ;)</p>

<p>I won‚Äôt get into the science of why this happens but do let me know if you want to discuss it.</p>

<p>‚ÄúOkay Tarun, we know salt is important now, but HOW MUCH TO USE IT!?‚Äù</p>

<h3 id="how-to-measure-salt">How to measure Salt?</h3>
<p>You can salt your dish ‚ÄúSwaad Anusaar‚Äù (<em>To Taste</em>) is something we hear just too often and I know everyone new to cooking has a tough time understanding the right quantity. 
See, I will be honest, there is no right amount of salt and people from different regions of the world actually have varying salt tolerances. So, the exact measure will develop only with time. However, I can surely help you get started.</p>

<p>Usually, the right quantity of salt lies anywhere between 1-1.5% by weight of the meal. So, for 100gms of curry, approximately 1-1.5gms of Salt. Remember, less salt can always be adjusted by adding more later, but there is no real way to adjust for more salt (Actually you can balance a bit of extra salt with a little lemon or sugar but with too much extra salt you are risking changing the flavour profile of dish). So, start with adding salt in steps and keep tasting the dish to understand the development. Please use a spoon to keep a measure, and don‚Äôt wing it by sprinkling :p .</p>

</p>

<p>Another tip is <strong>‚ÄúSeason as you go‚Äù</strong>, meaning salt each layer of the dish right away. Making a curry with 3 components? Salt the base gravy while cooking it, then salt it again when you add the tomato puree, and finally again when you add the 3rd component (Potato, paneer, veggies‚Ä¶). If you have some accompanying rice/pasta/noodles, you can add salt in the water you are boiling them in.</p>

<p>Follow these tips and I‚Äôm sure you will find your accurate measurement :)</p>

<h3 id="other-salts">Other Salts</h3>

<p>There are some other salts which are worth knowing.</p>

<h4 id="sea-salt">Sea Salt</h4>

<p>
Sea salt has bigger crytals and doesn't contain iodine like table salt, else they are mostly the same Sodium Chloride (NaCl). It's generally used as a finishing element while serving the dish providing better contrast and texture owing to it's crytal size and also a burst of flavour.

<h4 id="black-salt-kala-namak">Black Salt (<em>Kala Namak</em>)</h4>

<p>I really like this salt and it can do wonders when used rightly at the right places, let me explain!
In addition to the saltiness, it has a mild pungent flavour owing to the sulphur present in the compound. Use this in your lemonades, mocktails and similar drinks to give them a new dimension (careful though, add little by little!).
And it goes really well with snacks, especially Indian Chaat. You don‚Äôt know, but your favorite roadside vendor probably has this in his chaat masala, do try this at home and thank me later. :)</p>

<p>I hope you learnt something new today and will take these learnings with you to elevate your dishes and find your right salt measure! Keep Cooking folks.</p>

<p><em>Until next time‚Ä¶</em></p>
