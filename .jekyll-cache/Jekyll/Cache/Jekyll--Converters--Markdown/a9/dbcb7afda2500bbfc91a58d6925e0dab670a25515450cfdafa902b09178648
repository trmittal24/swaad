<p>Such questions bothering you? Calm down, calm down. I‚Äôm here to answer all your questions. We will start with why oils and fats are important in food, understand types of them, the differences, the similarities, and using each of them effectively to bring out the best flavours. 
Let‚Äôs get started.</p>

<h3 id="-importance-of-oils-and-fats">‚ùñ Importance of Oils and Fats</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Essential in correct quantities for the human body</li>
  <li>Enhances texture, taste and aroma of food</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Use oil and fats in your food in controlled quantities to get health and taste. Don‚Äôt try to eliminate them fully making your food bland. Ensure you use good quality and don‚Äôt let the oil go rancid.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That‚Äôs it for basic health related precautions, from here on I cover only flavour and cooking tips with them. Let me know if you want me to cover detailed health related perspective for Oils and Fats in a separate article.</p>

<p>Now, how does oil enhances the food quality? Oil can carry flavour molecules of spices, condiments and other flavouring agents, whereas water or other common liquids cannot. Hence, all spices are added in oil to begin with, to release their flavour, which essentially forms the base flavour profile for the entire dish.</p>

<p>The role of oil/fat doesn‚Äôt end there. While eating, oil coats your tongue, giving you a <em>lingering, longer lasting flavour sensation</em>, which will vanish in a second if not for it.</p>

<p>To conclude this section, I can say, oils and fats <strike>improves</strike> brings a new dimension to your dish in terms of flavour, texture and aroma. So, you shouldn‚Äôt hesitate from using and consuming it.</p>
