<p>Maybe a bit of exagerration there, but the Indians have absolutely owned the cuisine and created something beautiful. A few inspiration here and there from many Asian nations, but the one which has evolved to suit the spice and tangy loving nation.</p>

<p>You find delicious hakka noodles, fried rice, manchurian being tossed up high in woks, their aroma spread in every other street - north to south, east to west. Why? Because people love it and it‚Äôs actually very easy and quick. Just a few points to take care off, and soon those woks will be tossing lip-smacking food in your own kitchen. Let‚Äôs find out how. üòã</p>

<p><strong>What makes up a Indo-Chinese dish?</strong></p>

<p>‚Ä£ Thinly sliced veggies/meat
‚Ä£ Umami and a supporting flavour base
‚Ä£ Quick cooking and constant movement on highest heat
‚Ä£ Well defined separate components on dish on serving. (Not a sticky mess)</p>

<p>That‚Äôs pretty much all about it, and let‚Äôs get going to understand why these points are important and how to achieve them.</p>

<h3 id="-technique-the-skill">‚ùñ Technique, The Skill</h3>

<p>A perfect Indo-Chinese dish is the one, served right off the wok, steaming hot, all ingredients cooked enough to not be raw, but retain their crunchiness, everything separate that you can choose to nit pick (Don‚Äôt!), with a subtle supporting spicy and other flavour, not overpowering.</p>

<p>The thinly sliced veggies, high heat and well defined components are all inter-related and let me explain how.</p>

<h4 id="-heat-and-using-it-right">‚ùñ Heat and using it right</h4>

<p>All foods contain a large amount of water, and when you cook them, you essentially are reducing the water and cooking the protiens and starch. When you leave a bunch of chopped vegetables, they will cook, but at the same time, release water and get mushy in their own release. That is what we don‚Äôt want.</p>

<p>So, now when you slice them thin, use high heat and move them around constantly (either tossing or constant stirring), you are making sure that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The high heat and thin slice makes them release water quickly.</li>
  <li>The constant movement ensures that the water doesn‚Äôt stick around in the vessel and evaporates.</li>
</ul>

<p>Whatever vessel you are using, ensure that you don‚Äôt crowd it, leave enough empty room to move around your food.</p>

<h3 id="-umami-the-soul">‚ùñ Umami, The Soul</h3>

<p>What is umami? The savoury flavour, the aftertaste, little salty, but otherwise,</p>
