  <p>Ghee, Butter, Refined Oil - Can I mix them? Which one is healthy? Oh no! My food is getting too oily!  I‚Äôm confused, please help me.</p>

<p>Such questions bothering you? Calm down, calm down. I‚Äôm here to answer all your questions. We will start with why oils and fats are important in food, understand types of them, the differences, the similarities, and using each of them effectively to bring out the best flavours. 
Let‚Äôs get started.</p>

<h3 id="-importance-of-oils-and-fats">‚ùñ Importance of Oils and Fats</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Essential in correct quantities for the human body</li>
  <li>Enhances texture, taste and aroma of food</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Use oil and fats in your food in controlled quantities to get health and taste. Don‚Äôt try to eliminate them fully making your food bland. Ensure you use good quality and don‚Äôt let the oil go rancid.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That‚Äôs it for basic health related precautions, from here on I cover only flavour and cooking tips with them. Let me know if you want me to cover detailed health related perspective for Oils and Fats in a separate article.</p>

<p>Now, how does oil enhances the food quality? Oil can carry flavour molecules of spices, condiments and other flavouring agents, whereas water or other common liquids cannot. Hence, all spices are added in oil to begin with, to release their flavour, which essentially forms the base flavour profile for the entire dish.</p>

<p>The role of oil/fat doesn‚Äôt end there. While eating, oil coats your tongue, giving you a <em>lingering, longer lasting flavour sensation</em>, which will vanish in a second if not for it.</p>

<p>To conclude this section, I can say, oils and fats <strike>improves</strike> brings a new dimension to your dish in terms of flavour, texture and aroma. So, you shouldn‚Äôt hesitate from using and consuming it.</p>

<p>Also, in addition to this, oil locally produced are usually much cheaper than fats. It‚Äôs also important to note that fats, well, contain more fat and hence should be used with more control than oils.</p>

<h4 id="-the-battle-of-fats">‚ùñ The Battle of Fats</h4>

<p>Ghee (clarified butter) and butter are actually not that different. They actually follow the same production process, with ghee requiring one extra step, that is <em>clarification</em>. So, basically once you get butter from milk, heating it for a while removes all the water and clarifies it to make what we call ghee.</p>

<p>Butter is essentially an emulsion (blend of fat and water), and hence it helps makes your sauces very creamy helping all the oils and water in the sauce come very well together. Using just oil or ghee would make the fat separate from your sauce/gravy as we see in many Indian curries.</p>

<h3 id="-using-them-together">‚ùñ Using them Together</h3>

<p><em>Can I mix these and use?</em> Absolutely! And there are actually some good reasons to do it as well. Generally, there is a misconception among the people that you cannot mix oil and ghee, but don‚Äôt worry, you can. 
One difference we saw above was that, oil has a higher smoke point (that is it can withstand higher temperatures, before evaporating). So, if your dish requires higher temperature (eg: tadka/tempering), but you need richness which oil can‚Äôt provide, put in a bit of oil, and then add butter/ghee. The oil will prevent your fat from burning which will happen otherwise, and your kitchen will be smokey.</p>

<p>To sum up everything, Oils and Fats are important for your body and for your meals. Each variety</p>
