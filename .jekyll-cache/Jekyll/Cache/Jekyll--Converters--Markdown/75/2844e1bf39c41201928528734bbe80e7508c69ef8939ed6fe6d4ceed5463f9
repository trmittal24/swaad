  <p>Sourness, a word not quite the one that gives positive vibes. But? Also an element of your food, which is required to make it a complete the circle of perfect flavour.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Don‚Äôt believe me? Sourness is present in almost all your dishes in various forms!</p>

<p><em>That dash of lime juice in your daal</em> 
<em>The sour and sweet tamarind chutney for your chaats</em> 
<em>Tangy tomato present in ketchup or your favourite chips (But honestly, who even likes those Red Tangy Potato Chips?)</em> 
<em>Curd bringing in the slight sourness to your gravy based curries</em> 
<em>Vinegar in the Indo Chinese dishes!</em></p>

<p>You think I am done? No, wait. Even idlis, dosas, breads taste the way they do because of induced acidity. How? Fermentation! 
The batters for Idlis and Dosas are fermented overnight to make them airy and bring in the acidic profile.</p>

<p><em>Doughs for pizzas, breads, naan are fermented for long time using yeast or curd, which gives them the unique flavour.</em> 
<em>Cheese aged for a long time as a distinctive sourness</em> 
<em>Pickles! What even is a pickle which isn‚Äôt sour? And how it helps to complete your meal!</em></p>

<p>Am I done? Maybe üòù. The list is non-exhaustive, but I hope I have covered many of our day to day meals and made it clear how important of a role sourness or acid plays in our food.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs dig in a little deeper to understand why this happens and how can you leverage it to elevate your food.</p>

<h3 id="-acids-what-how-why">‚ùñ Acids: What? How? Why?</h3>

<p><em>Mouthwatering</em> is synonymous to food being delicious, and you know what? It‚Äôs the acidic food which makes your mouth water the most i.e your mouth releases the most saliva when eating something sour to balance the acidity. 
Acid is actually one of the flavours which we crave the most, and it‚Äôs important to understand how you can add this dimension to your food.</p>

<p>Acid, like <a href="https://swaad.in.net/salt">Salt</a> and <a href="https://swaad.in.net/oils_and_fats/">Fats</a> is one of the most basic element which can easily be added to your food and probably fetching more rewards than the effort you put in. üòã</p>

<p>Acids as we saw in the examples above, come in various forms, you can add them as a seasoning towards the end, you can make it the base of your food, or you could let your food nurture and develop the acidic nature on it‚Äôs own. 
Every method or every ingredient has a completely different degree of acidity to it, and it becomes helpful to know how much of flavour everything brings in individually and layer them right.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs learn them one by one, and hopefully by the end of it, you would already have multiple ideas to impress people with your food.</p>
