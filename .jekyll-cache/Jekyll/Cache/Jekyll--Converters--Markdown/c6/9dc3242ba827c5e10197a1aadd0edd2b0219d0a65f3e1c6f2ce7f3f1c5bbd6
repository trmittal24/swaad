I"R<p>Since umami has its own receptors rather than arising out of a combination of the traditionally recognized taste receptors, scientists now consider umami to be a distinct taste.
Umami has a mild but lasting aftertaste associated with salivation and a sensation of furriness on the tongue, stimulating the throat, the roof and the back of the mouth.[30][31] By itself, umami is not palatable, but it makes a great variety of foods pleasant, especially in the presence of a matching aroma.[32] Like other basic tastes, umami is pleasant only within a relatively narrow concentration range</p>
