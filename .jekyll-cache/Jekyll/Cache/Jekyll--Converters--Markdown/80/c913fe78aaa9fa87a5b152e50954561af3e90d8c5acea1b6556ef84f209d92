<p>I don’t think I need to tell what is it, but in case you are still wondering, it’s <em>Tea</em>.</p>

<p>Today, in this article, let’s learn how to make a good cup of tea and how you can adjust it to your needs as required. Let’s get started, shall we?</p>

<p>I like a 1:3 water to milk ratio but you can always adjust as per your likings. Ginger and cardamom are usually the most used spices in tea, but cinnamom, cloves and a dash of black pepper powder works well too. If you want to try but are hesitant, you can always use them in small amounts. Experiment and find out what you like. 😋</p>

<h4 id="brew">Brew</h4>

<p align="center">

</p>
<p>Take a vessel of your choice, pour the water in and turn up the heat. Put in the tealeaves at this stage and let it brew. You can have the flame on medium. Meanwhile, crush the ginger and the cardamom pod well!</p>

</p>
<p>Now add this crushed masala to the water.</p>

<p>This is the most important step of tea making, letting the tea brew patiently in the water. <em>Once you add milk, the tealeaves won’t have a lot of effect, so please don’t rush into it. Most of the people I know who struggle at making tea are the ones who are impatient here, don’t be, the wait will be all worth it.</em> It is okay if your water reduces to even half of what you started with. :P</p>

</p>

<p>Once the brew is dark and ready, pour in the milk and stir occasionally. You may be tempted to increase the heat, but again, take a deep breath and calm your temptations. Let it come to a boil on it’s own, and then you can either decrease the flame to lowest, or stir, or blow at it, to prevent the tea from spilling. Add 1 tbsp of sugar now. Let the tea get 2-3 boils. Don’t worry, the successive boils are pretty quick.</p>

</p>

<p>Done, strain, pour yourself and your loved ones some tea, sip on it and enjoy the warm conversations with a satisfying tea.</p>

<h4 id="bonus">Bonus</h4>
<ul>
  <li>You can pair the masalas according to the weather. Ginger, clove, black pepper are usually good in cold/rainy weather and something like cardamom, cinnamon, fennel are nice in summer. Please start with only a pinch of them if you are not sure of the flavour.</li>
  <li>I reccommend water ratio from 20% to 50% according to what you like.</li>
  <li>Try to use milk which is not pre-boiled. In my experiments, fresh milk has given much better flavour.</li>
  <li>Always add sugar towards the end because it releases water which slows brewing, but make sure to give at least 1 boil after adding it.</li>
  <li>Use a vessel at least twice the volume of tea you are making, to avoid regretting spillover later.</li>
</ul>
