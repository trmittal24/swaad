  <p>Craving that restaurant style curry, or that lip-smacking dhaba dish? Hard to replicate? Nope! Let me help</p>

<p>Take your food to the next level, by using fats correctly in your cooking, don‚Äôt underuse it, but don‚Äôt overdo it either. Our traditional home food generally has less oil than outside food, but that‚Äôs what (in addition to other tips coming your way soon üòâ) makes their food more desirable. More fat doesn‚Äôt necessarily imply unhealthy, because remember, you at home are using good fats, and it won‚Äôt cause you any problems.</p>

<p>We covered the differences between the fats and their importance in food in <a href="https://swaad.in.net/oils_and_fats/">this article</a>, and this is a follow up to that. 
Today, I take you through using different Fats at different stages of cooking to get the ultimate result,  which will leave your guests licking their fingers. 
If we notice, some or the other kind of fat forms a important part of every cuisine.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ghee        - Punjabi and Marwadi Cuisine</li>
  <li>Mustard Oil - Bihar and Bengali Cuisine</li>
  <li>Coconut Oil - Kerala Cuisine</li>
  <li>Sesame Oil  - Chinese Food</li>
  <li>Olive Oil   - Italian Cuisine</li>
  <li>Butter      - French Cuisine</li>
</ul>

<p>Many Asian and Western Cuisines also use Animal meat based fat as a main part of their dish.</p>

<p>So, by selecting the right Fat, you are already half way into making a great dish! :D</p>

<p>How to use them? Lets‚Äôs get started!</p>

<p>Oil in start of curry
required to keep curry moist, transfer flavours, form the base
indication of food is cooked
final tempering for a fresh flavour and aroma
butter in the end of dish</p>

<p>ghee on roti and bread and khichdi</p>

<p>butter, olive oil in pasta</p>

<p>oil in chinese food</p>

<p>Such questions bothering you? Calm down, calm down. I‚Äôm here to answer all your questions. We will start with why oils and fats are important in food, understand the types of them, the differences, the similarities, and using each of them effectively to bring out the best flavours. 
Let‚Äôs get started.</p>

<h3 id="-importance-of-oils-and-fats">‚ùñ Importance of Oils and Fats</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Essential in correct quantities for the human body</li>
  <li>Enhances texture, taste and aroma of food</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Use oil and fats in your food in controlled quantities to get health and taste. Don‚Äôt try to eliminate them fully making your food bland. Ensure you use good quality and don‚Äôt let the oil go rancid.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That‚Äôs it for basic health related precautions, from here on I cover only flavour and cooking tips with them. Let me know if you want me to cover a detailed health related perspective for Oils and Fats in a separate article.</p>

<p>Now, how does oil enhances food quality? Oil can carry flavour molecules of spices, condiments and other flavouring agents, whereas water or other common liquids cannot. Hence, all spices are added in oil to begin with, to release their flavour, which essentially forms the base flavour profile for the entire dish.</p>

<p>The role of oil/fat doesn‚Äôt end there. While eating, oil coats your tongue, giving you a <em>lingering, longer lasting flavour sensation</em>, which will vanish in a second if not for it.</p>

<p>To conclude this section, I can say, oils and fats <strike>improve</strike> brings a new dimension to your dish in terms of flavour, texture and aroma. So, you shouldn‚Äôt hesitate from using and consuming it.</p>

<p>Also, in addition to this, oils locally produced are usually much cheaper than fats. It‚Äôs also important to note that fats, well, contain more fat and hence should be used with more control than oils.</p>

<h4 id="-the-battle-of-fats">‚ùñ The Battle of Fats</h4>

<p>Ghee (clarified butter) and butter are not that different. They actually follow the same production process, with ghee requiring one extra step, that is <em>clarification</em>. So, basically once you get butter from milk, heating it for a while removes all the water and clarifies it to make what we call ghee.</p>

<p>Butter is essentially an emulsion (blend of fat and water), and hence it helps makes your sauces very creamy helping all the oils and water in the sauce come very well together. Using just oil or ghee would make the fat separate from your sauce/gravy as we see in many Indian curries.</p>

<h3 id="-using-them-together">‚ùñ Using them Together</h3>

<p><em>Can I mix these and use them?</em> Absolutely! And there are some genuine reasons to do it as well. Generally, there is a misconception among the people that you cannot mix oil and ghee, but don‚Äôt worry, you can.</p>

<p>One difference we saw above was that, oil has a higher smoke point (that is it can withstand higher temperatures, before evaporating). So, if your dish requires higher temperature (eg: tadka/tempering), but you need richness which oil can‚Äôt provide, put in a bit of oil, and then add butter/ghee. The oil will prevent your fat from burning which will happen otherwise, and your kitchen will be smokey.</p>

<p>To sum up everything, Oils and Fats are important for your body and for your meals. Each variety brings something unique to the table, and you can use their virtues to make your dish shine! :)</p>
