Hola, it's me, Tarun! :)
An engineer by profession, a chess player by hobby and a cook in every other moment. 
I like to explore everything, stay curious and unearth the reasoning behind how things behave the way they do.
Or rather.... why foods taste the way they do and how can you make it better in a simpler way. 
And that's my motivation for Swaad.

<h4>About Swaad</h4>

Always confused why your dishes never come out perfect even though you follow the "Recipe" perfectly? <br> <br>

Fed up and looking for something better to impress your friends and family? <br>

Come on, let me help you please. <br> <br>

Most of the recipes online give you the ingredients and steps but fail to tell you why they are important, which steps you can get away without affecting your dish, while which are the ones absolutely essential for your dish to end up similar to expectations. <br> <br>

This blog is intended to equip you better in the kitchen with new knowledge about the basic ingredients, processes and techniques to help you experiment successfully and own your dish. I will also provide you with some recipes keeping in mind they are not too specific and provide you the freedom to try your own version! <br> <br>

Please show some love, give feedback: good or bad and let's get cooking! <br> <br>
